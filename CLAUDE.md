## Claude-specific wiring (nothing project-level here)

| Thing | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Project instructions | `AGENTS.md`, imported above | Claude Code reads only `CLAUDE.md`, so this file exists purely to import it. |
| Skills (`/ship`, `/docs-sync`) | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Symlinks into `.agents/skills/` — the shared bodies every client uses. Edit the target, never the link. |
| Session bootstrap | `.claude/settings.json` → `SessionStart` → `.agents/setup.sh` | Same script Codex and OpenCode call. Installs Nix in cloud containers, no-ops locally. |
| Worktree hooks | `~/.claude/settings.json` (yours, not the repo's) → `holt hook create` / `holt hook remove` | Claude owns that file and rewrites it, so the rice never touches it — which is why these were repointed off frozen `wt` by hand. |

The full cross-harness map is [`.agents/README.md`](./.agents/README.md).
