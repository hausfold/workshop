# AGENTS.md

**Trill** — a quiet, scriptable notification compositor for macOS. Draws its
own silent banners for events from local sources (CLI socket today; an
experimental read-only mirror of Apple's `usernoted` store behind a flag).
Part of the [nebelhaus](https://github.com/nebelhaus) family; stands alone
like pounce and perch.

> **The name was reused, deliberately — this is not the old Trill.** Until
> 2026-08-08 this app was called **flick**, and "trill" belonged to the
> family's iMessage/SMS client, which is finished and archived. The name moved
> because a trill is the small chirred note a cat makes in passing, which is
> what a quiet notification compositor is; an ear-flick was the second-best
> version of the same image. If you find a reference to "Trill, the Messages
> client", it is about the archived repo in the `nebelhaus` org, **not** about
> this codebase — don't reconcile the two, and don't "restore" the flick name.
> The old app now lives at `nebelhaus/messages`, archived, and its Homebrew
> cask is gone; the whole story is in the workshop's
> `notes/hausfold-rename.md` §3.4.

**This file is the one set of instructions, for every agent.** Claude Code,
Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Copilot — TUI or GUI — all read *this*, directly or
through a one-line pointer. Nothing harness-specific belongs here; when a flow
needs per-client wiring (a hook, a slash command), the wiring lives in that
client's own file and the *content* stays here or in `.agents/`. The map of
which tool reads which file is [`.agents/README.md`](./.agents/README.md).

## Am I in the right repo? (routing)

**This repo owns THE NOTIFICATION COMPOSITOR** — the daemon, its providers,
the rules engine, the banner/inbox UI, and the `trill` CLI. Nothing about how
it's launched, themed at the source, or packaged.

| Want to change… | Repo |
|---|---|
| the trill app (compositor, providers, rules, CLI, inbox) | **you are here** |
| how trill is *installed* on the system (flake wiring, launchd) | `nebelhaus` (the rice) |
| the palette trill is themed with (source hex) | `nebelung` |
| DND / Focus toggling ("Hush") | `nebelhaus` (the rice) — trill only deep-links there |
| trill's Homebrew cask (once released) | `homebrew-tap` — CI-owned. The `trill` token is free: the archived Messages client's cask was deleted on 2026-08-08. |
| the flake's release pin (`nix/release.nix`) | this repo — **CI-owned**; never hand-bump |

> **Whatever agent you are, enforce this.** A color hex, a launchd plist, or a
> Focus toggle does not belong here even if it would work.

## The one rule that explains everything

**The compositor never blocks on — or trusts — a provider.** Every provider
is supervised in its own task, speaks only `NotificationEvent` (its native
types stop at its own boundary), advertises `ProviderHealth` from an explicit
`probe()`, and when it fails it fails *closed into "off with a reason"*,
never into a broken pipeline. Corollaries:

- **System Mirror is quarantined.** The `usernoted` store is opened
  `SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`, schema-probed before every session, and disabled
  with a visible reason on any drift. It is opt-in, experimental, and the
  app must stay fully useful without it. No usernoted type or column name
  may appear outside `Providers/SystemMirror/`.
- **trill reads Apple's settings; it never writes them.** `trill doctor` and
  the "Silence Native Banners" helper decode the private per-app store
  read-only (`Platform/NotificationSettingsAudit`)
  to say which apps macOS still banners or sounds itself. Opening the pane
  and animating the two clicks is the whole offer — do **not** add a "fix it
  for me" that writes that plist, however easy it looks. Only the three
  corroborated bits are read (on-screen alert `1<<3`/`1<<4`, sound `1<<2`, and
  **allow-notifications `1<<25`**); don't extend to bits whose meaning is
  folklore, and if you must, corroborate against real data first and say so in
  the comment. **Never read style or sound without checking `1<<25` first** —
  macOS freezes those bits at their last values when the master switch goes
  off, so skipping it reports every app the user already silenced. That bug
  shipped once. Bit 29 is the counter-example worth remembering: it looked
  like the allow bit until its set turned out to be the community's
  "time-sensitive apps" list. And when you touch the helper's demo, **check
  the pane on the current macOS first** — Tahoe replaced None/Banners/Alerts
  with a Desktop checkbox plus Temporary/Persistent, and the demo shipped once
  miming controls that no longer existed. The bits didn't move; the words did,
  and the words are the whole product here.
- **Read the store macOS actually writes, and admit when you can't.** On
  macOS 26 the per-app switches live in
  `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.usernoted/Library/Preferences/group.com.apple.usernoted.plist`.
  **`com.apple.ncprefs` is a stale mirror** — same `apps` array, same
  plausible `flags`, not what System Settings writes. Measured here:
  byte-identical to a 17-day-old copy across a change made in the pane and 45
  minutes of watching, while the group container took that change within
  seconds. Every write-up online names ncprefs, which is exactly why it's a
  trap; trill shipped it once and the helper panel looked broken as a result.
  That container is TCC-protected, so the read needs **Full Disk Access** —
  and therefore the audit has **three** verdicts, not two: noisy, quiet, and
  *can't tell*. `readAll()` returns nil for the third; rendering it as "all
  quiet" is the bug that must never come back (`trill doctor` exits **5**,
  Settings says "can't tell", the helper still walks but confirms nothing).
- **The helper advances on the user's word, not on a watch.** Because that
  store needs FDA and can't be assumed readable, the walkthrough's **Done**
  button is the mechanism and the poll is a bonus that ticks apps off where
  it can. Don't "fix" the panel by making it wait for confirmation again.
- **The queue is the truth; panels are disposable.** Display topology
  rebuilds re-render from `BannerQueue` state. Never park event state in a
  panel or view.
- **No sound.** There is no audio call anywhere in this codebase; don't add
  one, even "just for critical".
- **No notification content in logs.** Ids and source slugs only —
  `Logger` privacy annotations are load-bearing.
- **Never steal focus.** Banners ride non-activating panels; nothing in
  this app may take key focus except windows the user summoned (inbox,
  settings).
- Decisions are pure: `PolicyEngine` reads (event, rules, clock) and touches
  no I/O. New delivery behaviors go through `DeliveryDecision`, not ad-hoc
  branches in the queue.

## Layout (pounce/perch convention)

```text
Trill/
  App/           entry, composition root, settings
  CLI/           `trill send/ping` — same binary, CLI personality
  Domain/        NotificationEvent, RuleSet, PolicyEngine (pure)
  Providers/     protocol + Socket (shipping) + SystemMirror (quarantined)
  Repositories/  EventRepository actor: supervise, normalize, dedupe, fan out
  Persistence/   AppDatabase — trill's OWN sqlite; the only writer in the app
  Compositor/    ScreenGeometry (pure), BannerQueue, panels, window system
  Platform/      ActionRouter, SystemIntegration (all Apple hooks, one file)
  UI/            BannerView, InboxView, SettingsView
TrillTests/      geometry, policy, pipeline — pure logic tests, no display
```

## Verifying

`xcodebuild -project Trill.xcodeproj -scheme Trill test` (or let CI run it).
Geometry, policy, queue, and wire-format logic are all testable headless —
keep it that way: anything that *can* be a pure function with a test should
be. Feel-testing banners needs a real session: build, run, `trill send`.

**Debug builds carry their own bundle id (`com.hausfold.trill.debug`) — leave
it that way.** TCC keys Full Disk Access by *bundle id*, one row per id, and
rewrites that row's stored code requirement to whichever binary asked last.
While the Debug build shared the release id, every `xcodebuild test` launched
an Apple-Development-signed host that asked for FDA, failed to match, and took
the row over — after which the installed Developer-ID app was denied, silently,
because `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles` never prompts. It cost an afternoon
of "the grant keeps dropping" and looked like a signing bug. The Debug build
also gets its own `Application Support/Trill (debug)` so a test run can't bind
the installed daemon's socket or write its database.

**Feel-test with `scripts/dev-install.sh`, not a bare `xcodebuild`.** A
`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` build is ad-hoc signed, and macOS pins a TCC grant
(Full Disk Access) to an ad-hoc bundle's **cdhash** — so the switch in System
Settings revokes itself on your next build, and stale `Trill.app` copies all
claiming `com.hausfold.trill` make Apple's "Quit & Reopen" relaunch the wrong
one. The script signs with the Developer ID (team-anchored requirement → the
grant survives every rebuild), unregisters the strays, and installs one copy at
`~/Applications/Trill.app`. Pass `--reset-permissions` once when coming from an
ad-hoc build.

Cloud sessions: edit + test-plan only; `xcodebuild` and feel-testing are
macOS-local jobs (see the workshop's `AGENTS.md`, "Cloud sessions"). The shared
`.agents/setup.sh` gets Nix onto a bare container so the flake resolves; it
cannot make a Linux box build a macOS app.
