#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# dev-install.sh — build Flick from this checkout, sign it with a *stable*
# identity, and leave exactly one copy where macOS will find it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the Full Disk Access bug it fixes permanently)
#
# `xcodebuild … CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` — the command in BOOTSTRAP.md, fine
# for tests — produces an **ad-hoc signed** bundle. macOS stores a TCC grant
# (Full Disk Access) against the app's *designated requirement*, and for an
# ad-hoc bundle that requirement pins the binary's **cdhash**, which changes on
# every single build. The moment a differently-hashed `com.nebelhaus.flick`
# launches, macOS can no longer match the app it granted, so it revokes: the
# switch in System Settings turns itself back off while you watch.
#
# Signing with the Developer ID makes that requirement name the **team**
# (88M28542LQ) instead of a hash — so the grant survives every rebuild, and
# you grant Full Disk Access once, ever.
#
# The other half of the same bug: several stale `Flick.app` copies
# (DerivedData, `build/`, old installs) all claim `com.nebelhaus.flick`, and
# Apple's own "Quit & Reopen" button relaunches **by bundle id** — so it can
# relaunch a copy the grant was never made against. This script unregisters
# the strays and leaves one canonical install at ~/Applications/Flick.app.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev-install.sh                  build, sign, install, relaunch
#   scripts/dev-install.sh --reset-permissions
#                                           …and wipe flick's existing TCC
#                                           rows first (needed once, when
#                                           switching from an ad-hoc build:
#                                           the stale row can't be matched
#                                           against the new signature)
#
# Override the identity with FLICK_SIGN_IDENTITY= if you sign under another
# team.

Full Disk Access, once:
  Flick menu bar → Settings… → Unlock System Mirror…
  The assistant walks you through the pane and closes itself the moment the
  grant lands — access is picked up live, so either answer to Apple's
  "Quit & Reopen" sheet works. "Later" changes nothing; "Quit & Reopen"
  is finished by Flick's own watchdog, since macOS quits background-only
  apps without ever performing the reopen.

Every later run of this script keeps that grant.
