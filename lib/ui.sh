# The standard ships as two implementations of one spec, because bash cannot
# link a Go library:
#
#   hausfold/snug   the Go package, and the `snug` binary shell callers drive
#   THIS FILE       the same spec, at lower fidelity, for a machine with no
#                   `snug` on PATH
#
# When is that? An older generation still on someone's disk, a script invoked
# off a thin PATH (a launchd job, a `ssh mac bench …` with no login shell), a
# `bench` checkout on a Mac that never installed the layer, and CI. On those,
# this is the whole painter — so it has to be honest on its own, not a stub
# that assumes the real thing is one directory away.

# ── how this stays in step with snug ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Every number here is snug's number, and the comments say so where it matters.
# Two tests hold that: `test/ui.bats` recomputes the 256-colour table from the
# hex below, and diffs the hex against snug's `palette.go` whenever a snug
# checkout is beside this one. A fallback that drew a DIFFERENT line from the
# binary would be worse than no fallback at all — it would make "which machine
# is this?" a question you have to ask about your own output.
#
# ⚠️ Deliberately NOT a wrapper around `snug` when snug happens to be present.
# The dispatch belongs to the caller: it opens ONE coprocess for a whole command
# (a fork is ~4.5 ms, and sixty forks is a third of a second of nothing), and a
# library sourced per script cannot see the command boundary that decision needs.
#
# Bash 4+ — associative arrays, `${var,,}`, `printf -v`. Every family CLI
# already requires it (`declare -gA`, `$EPOCHSECONDS`), and macOS's /bin/bash
# 3.2 is not what any of them run under.

# Sourced more than once — bench sources this, and the bats harness sources
# bench — is a no-op, not a re-detection: `ui_measure` is the only thing that
# should ever re-read the window.

# ── the palette ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Nine roles. A tool names a role, never a colour — that indirection is the
# whole point. Seven hand-picked 256-colour indices, copy-pasted into four
# files, is how the family ended up ΔE 2–27 from the flavour every other tool on
# this machine was wearing, with two different greys for one role and a primary
# accent that resolved to BLUE, the one hue nebelung exists to strip out.
#
# The hex is nebelung's, by way of snug's generated `palette.go` — which is the
# source, and which `test/ui.bats` diffs this against.
#
# The 256-colour index beside each is DECLARED, not searched at load time. It is
# `nearest256` from snug's theme.go — the closest of xterm's 216-colour cube and
# its 24-step grey ramp, searched rather than divided out because the cube's
# levels (0 95 135 175 215 255) are not evenly spaced. Declaring it costs a test
# (which recomputes every one) and saves ~2000 arithmetic iterations in every
# script that sources this, for an answer that can only change when the palette
# does.
#
# ⚠️ `sapphire` (#7dc6e7) and `teal` (#9be0d5) both resolve to 116 on the dark
# variants, so `subject` and `path` are the same colour at 256. That is the
# palette's arithmetic, not a typo here — snug's binary does the same thing, and
# the fallback matching it is the point. Worth fixing in nebelung's tokens or in
# snug's roleToken if it ever reads as a bug; do not fix it only here.
