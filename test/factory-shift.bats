# Unit tests for `script/factory-shift` — and specifically for the passes that
# CANNOT see, which are the ones a night shift has to get right.
#
# The shift's product is a log somebody reads in the morning instead of having
# watched. So the failure that matters is not a crash: it is a pass that sensed
# nothing, said nothing about that, and ended on output identical to a quiet
# night. There are four ways to be blind — the repo list, one repo's PR list,
# one PR's tier verdict, one repo's main CI — and each has a case below.
#
# `gh`, `trill` and `factory-tier` are all stubbed. Stubbing `trill` is not
# tidiness: `setup()` PREPENDS to PATH, so a real `trill` on a developer's
# machine is still found by `notify`'s `command -v`, and several cases here
# reach a `notify fault`. The screen belongs to whoever is sitting at it, and
# running a test suite is never a reason to take it. The stub also records its
# calls, which makes the notify POLICY testable — see the pair of cases on it.
