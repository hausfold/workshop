# Unit tests for `script/factory-watchdog` — the layer that notices the FOREMAN
# stopped, which `factory-shift`'s own unknown-lines cannot, because writing one
# requires a pass that ran.
#
# The shape being pinned is the one docs/factory.md's *When the foreman dies*
# records: a session whose dynamic loop ended in an API error, so no next wakeup
# was ever scheduled. Every case here is a variation on "the log went quiet
# while the lease stayed live", because that pair is the entire signal.
#
# Three cases below are REGRESSION tests for bugs this script shipped with in
# review, and each one made the revoke unreachable rather than merely wrong —
# they are marked ⚠ and are the reason the suite exists at all:
#   • the watchdog's own log line resetting the mtime it reads,
#   • yesterday's log outranking today's grant stamp,
#   • a lease revoked out from under a foreman because the MACHINE slept.
#
# `trill` is stubbed and PATH is PREPENDED, so `notify`'s `command -v` finds the
# stub rather than the real binary on a developer's Mac. Several cases reach a
# `notify fault`, and a test suite is never a reason to put a card on somebody's
# screen. The stub records its calls, which makes the card POLICY — one per
# stall, re-armed by a recovery — testable rather than merely unobtrusive.
#
# The lease file is usually written directly rather than through `factory-lease
# grant`, because `grant` now spawns a real poller and a leaked one would
# outlive the test that spawned it. The two cases that DO call `grant` are the
# ones whose subject is that spawn, and they stop it themselves.
