#
# The width sweeps are the point and are what to run first when anything in
# there changes. Everything this library exists for is one rule —
#
#   nothing it draws may reach the terminal's last column
#
# — and every defect it was written for is a violation of it: a `%-34s` row that
# is 48 cells whatever the job is called, a `\r` into the middle of a wrapped
# line, a `printf` that padded by bytes. "Should rarely" is not the promise;
# `may not, at any width, in any tier` is.
#
# ── two things the harness does on purpose ───────────────────────────────────
# SNUG_ASCII=1 in the sweeps, so that one byte is one character is one cell and
# `${#s}` is a cell count in ANY locale — CI's included, where `LANG` is unset
# and a `✓` would otherwise measure three. The arithmetic under test does not
# know which alphabet it is in; the alphabet gets its own test below.
#
# UI_TTY / UI_COLS / UI_AVAIL are set by hand rather than by a pty, the same way
# snug's Go tests construct a `Term`. That is what makes a 199-width sweep cost
# one fork instead of two hundred. The one thing a pty is genuinely needed for —
# `stty size` against a real window — gets a real pty at the bottom.
